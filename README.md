# Neural Dream Video
This repo is a fork of [neural-dream](https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-dream) and can generate consistnet deep-dream style video based on input video.

This repo is mostly compatible with the original repo, so please refer to [README](https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-dream/blob/master/README.md) of parent repo for:
- Pytorch, CUDA, cuDNN installation
- Model download
- Parameter explanation
- FAQs
